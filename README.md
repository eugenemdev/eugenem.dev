This is personal blog and website, what was written on pure Javascript.

Tehnologies were used:
- Webpack (ES6) 
- NodeJS as backend 
- GraphQL

P.S. The backend has the transitional structure and works yet with frontend was written on REST. Soon it's planned to rewrite frontend to the same technology.
